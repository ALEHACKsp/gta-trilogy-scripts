# GTA Trilogy Remastered Mission Scripts
## _Original script sources of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City and Grand Theft Auto: III, from the "remaster/definitive" PC edition_

I've obtained these files by unpacking gta.pak from each game. Their location is /Gameface/Content/OriginalData/{Game}/full_script_text.txt or fakeMainOutputFile.txt (in the case of SA). All sources contain original comments. 

Apparently the Switch version contains even more cool stuff to look at, but I don't have that, so I can't do anything about it.

**NOTE:** War Drum either didn't fully document their changes to the script files, or they barely edited them for their ports. You can see this by opening the script files in something like VSCode and searching for the following keywords: "3master" "WDTOM" "WDAaron". Notice how there's barely any results.

**Also,** eat shit, Take2 & Rockstar for taking down mods and the original versions and greenlighting this garbage port.
